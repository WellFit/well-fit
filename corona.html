       <center><h3>WHAT IS COVID19?</h3></center>
<p style="color: white;font-family: Times New Roman" >COVID19 is the new respiratory disease causing an outbreak around the world and it is
caused by a highly infectious and dangerous coronavirus.It is highly communicable, extensive and causes mild to extreme illness.The virus can be symptomatic or asymptomatic .COVID19 is short for “Coronavirus disease 2019.”
<ul>
<li style="
color:#960018;font-family: Times New Roman">The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who are in close
contact with one another (about 6 feet) and through respiratory droplets
produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
 <li style="
color:#960018;font-family: Times New Roman">People are most contagious when they are the sickest. But those who don’t
have a lot of symptoms can still pass the virus on to others.</li>
 <li style="
color:#960018;font-family: Times New Roman">There is currently no vaccine or cure for COVID19 but researchers are
working to find one.</li>
</ul></p>

        <center><h3 style="color: white">HOW TO PROTECT OURSELF AND OTHERS?</h3></center>
        <h3 style="color: white">Washing Your Hands</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li style="color:#960018">Wet your hands with clean, running water.</li>
 <li style="color:#960018">Lather your hands by rubbing them together. Get the backs of your hands,
between your fingers, and under your nails.</li>
 
<li style="color:#960018">Scrub your hands for 20 seconds. Sing your favourite song while
washing to gauge your timing.</li>
<li style="color:#960018">No soap or water? Use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent
alcohol. Rub your hands together over all of your hands’ surfaces and
fingers until your hands are dry.</li>
</ul></p>
    </div>

   
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Physical Distancing</h3>
        <div id="s">
     <p style="color: white">Physical distancing means putting space between yourself and people outside your home to prevent the transmission of the disease.</p>
<ul>
<li style="color:#960018">Avoid physical contact with other people.</li>
 <li style="color:#960018">Stay at least 6 feet away from people when outside your house. This
includes friends or loved ones. Same goes for other people’s pets.</li>
 <li style="color:#960018">Do not invite guests to your home.</li>
 <li style="color:#960018">Avoid groups and crowds.</li>
 <li style="color:#960018">In places where physical distancing might be difficult, like the grocery store
or pharmacy, do your best to stay 6 feet away from others. Wear a cloth
face covering.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="container" id="s">
    <h3>Cleaning and Disinfecting Surfaces</h3>
<p style="color: white">Commonly used surfaces should be regularly cleaned and disinfected.
<ul>
<li style="color:#960018">It’s always a good idea to routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched
surfaces like tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets,
faucets, and sinks. But if you have a suspected or confirmed case of
COVID19, be vigilant about doing this daily.</li>
 <li style="color:#960018">First, clean dirty surfaces with soap and water. Cleaning will remove dirt
and lower the number of germs—but it will not kill germs.</li>
 <li style="color:#960018">Wear dedicated gloves for COVID19 related cleaning and disinfecting or
use disposable gloves and discard them after each use.</li>
 
</ul></p>
</div>
<div class="container" id="s">
    <h3>Wearing a Cloth Face Covering</h3>
<p style="color: white">Using a cloth mask can protect yourself and others from germs and help slow
the spread.
<ul>
<li style="color:#960018">Wear your mask over your mouth and nose. Make sure it fits snugly but
comfortably against the side of your face. It should have ear loops or tie in
the back.</li>
 <li style="color:#960018">Wear your mask in public, especially in places where it’s hard to practice
physical distancing, like grocery stores or pharmacies.</li>
 <li style="color:#960018">When you remove the mask, take it off carefully without touching your eyes,
nose, or mouth. Wash your hands immediately.</li>
 <li style="color:#960018">To sanitize your mask, routinely wash it in the washing machine in hot
water.</li>
 
</ul></p>
